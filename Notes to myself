Branch Naming Convention
A git branch should start with a category. Pick one of these: feature, bugfix, hotfix, or test.
* feature is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature.
* bugfix is for fixing a bug.
* hotfix is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency).
* test is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket.
After the category, there should be a "/" followed by the reference of the issue/ticket you are working on. If there's no reference, just add no-ref.
Ex: git branch <category/reference/description-in-kebab-case>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commit naming convention
A commit message should start with a category of change and they are:
* feat is for adding a new feature.
* fix is for fixing a bug.
* refactor is for changing code for peformance or convenience purpose (e.g. readibility).
* chore is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc.).
After the category, there should be a ":" announcing the commit description.
